# Week Three

Make sure to read through the entire document and Tracker Stories before starting so you know what you're doing! Ask questions before you leave class on Friday.


### Acceptance Criteria:

This week, we'll be refactoring our application to be more like a production-level application with Knex and server-side validations:

* Refactor the queries to your database out into a separate file
* Refactor the queries to your database to use [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/)
* Add server-side validations for restaurants and reviews

New [Tracker Stories](../tracker-stories/week-3.csv) exist for this week, so make sure to import them!
