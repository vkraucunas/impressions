# Week Four

Make sure to read through the entire document and Tracker Stories before starting so you know what you're doing! Ask questions before you leave class on Friday.


### Acceptance Criteria:

This week, you'll be finishing your restaurant applications and adding a bit of authentication.

* Add a register button on your page where a user can signup/login using some OAuth service. You should save user information into your database and it should ideally include at least a first and last name.
* If a user is logged in, they can see the "Create New Review" button and can create a new review.
* If a user is an admin, they can see the "Add New Restaurant" button and create/delete restaurants.

New [Tracker Stories](../tracker-stories/week-4.csv) exist for this week, so make sure to import them!
