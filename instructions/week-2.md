# Week Two

Make sure to read through the entire document and Tracker Stories before starting so you know what you're doing! Ask questions before you leave class on Friday.


### Acceptance Criteria:

This week, we'll be turning our Restaurants Application into a full-fledged CRUD application! You'll need to do the following:

* Update your current routes to use a database
* On any form submission, create or update the correct restaurant
* Delete restaurant rows
* Create new routes, tables, and views for reviews
* Dynamically generate a restaurant's ratings based on reviews

The mockups also include a section for adding / editing employees. This is a stretch goal but is not required. New [Tracker Stories](../tracker-stories/week-2.csv) exist for this week, so make sure to import them!
